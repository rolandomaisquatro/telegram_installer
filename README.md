# telegram_installer
This is a simple bash script for those who don't know how to install Telegram on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Arch or any debian based distro. I haven't tested this in other distros but it will probably work fine!

To Run, just download the shell script, open a terminal and run the bash script by using $sh telegram_installer.sh

Just to let you know, this script requires sudo installed in the system, and that the user installing Telegram be in the sudo group.

Hope everybody like it and tweak the code to make it better. 


Kind regards;
