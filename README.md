# telegram_installer
This is a simple bash script for those who don't know how to install Telegram on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Arch or any debian based distro. I haven't tested this in other distros but it will probably work fine!

To Run, just download the shell script, open a terminal and run the bash script by using bash telegram_installer.sh
